Make the questions multiple choice with 3 wrong answers based on common misconceptions for the math skill and one correct answer. Include all of the necessary information in each  word problem that the student needs to solve the problem. The three problems should be independent of one another.Provide a comprehensive explanation for why each of the four options is either right or wrong.Create hints that progressively guide students towards solving the problem. The first hint should introduce the concept, the second should provide an analogy, and the third should outline the step-by-step solution without revealing the answer.",
    "7.EE.B.4.A": "{story} \n Based on the story above, give me 3 word problems for  CCSS.7.EE.B.4.A: Solve word problems leading to equations of the form px + q = r and p(x + q) = r, where p, q, and r are specific rational numbers. Solve equations of these forms fluently. Compare an algebraic solution to an arithmetic solution, identifying the sequence of the operations used in each approach.  For example:\"Taylor ate 11 ice cream bars over the summer. Grace ate 8 ice cream bars. How many more ice cream bars did Taylor eat than Grace? or \"There are 5 bluebirds flying around. They found 9 more bluebirds. How many bluebirds are there altogether?\" Make the questions multiple choice with 3 wrong answers based on common misconceptions for the math skill and one correct answer.

    "7.EE.B.4.B": "{story} \n Based on the story above, give me 3 word problems for  CCSS.7.EE.B.4.B: Solve word problems leading to inequalities of the form px + q > r or px + q < r, where p, q, and r are specific rational numbers. Graph the solution set of the inequality and interpret it in the context of the problem.  For example:\"Taylor ate 11 ice cream bars over the summer. Grace ate 8 ice cream bars. How many more ice cream bars did Taylor eat than Grace? or \"There are 5 bluebirds flying around. They found 9 more bluebirds.
